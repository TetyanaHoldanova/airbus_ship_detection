# airbus_ship_detection
## Project Description
Deep Learning models for detecting ships in satellite images [Kaggle Airbus Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection). 

## Dataset
The dataset used consisted of a set of images for training and testing, as well as a .csv file that contained rle-encoded strings for the training masks.
The dataset was imbalanced, so the following was performed during image preprocessing:
* Delete damaged photos with size < 50 kb
* Resize images from 768x768 to 256x256 (optional step)
* Stratified sampling (2000 pictures for each number of depicted ships)
